This is a draft for develop designs.

Part 1: Basic machine

Since we are working on a basic machine of several parts:

	Basic machine architecture
	Simple Memory
	Load and Store instructions
	User interface

I am here building a simple user interface as a further development skeleton. 
This interface will show several things: the simulated panel which serves as 
the 'Machine' panel, another panel with several 'States' of the CPU and memory. 

Now we have chips and cables to wire them up. 

For how we wire them up, please refer to the definition file, whose name is chipsDef.ini

The design of instructions goes into another file, whose name is controlDef.ini
